## Developing cargo-bikeable infrastructure to/from IKEAs around the US

This project was influenced by my recent trip to the IKEA near Boston. I do not own a car, nor do I drive one. The closest point of public transport to Boston's IKEA is about a 15 minute bike ride away. How would having a set of cargo-bikes stationed at such transit points help in reducing car trips to/from IKEA? This project aims to find that out.
